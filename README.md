# Gus's Study Guide for A Coding Beginner 

## Description

this study guide is built with the intention to help new coding beginners navigate how to design the front end portion of a webpage. I was motivated to build this webpage because I, too, am a beginner navigating this new and daunting world of code. I am interested in learning code because I am eager to build my skillsket as I'm sure many others who come across this page may share. This webpage is a quick study guide on how to structure a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through building this page I also learned the basics of how to apply these concepts put into practice. I do hope others who come across this page share the same goals and values!

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
